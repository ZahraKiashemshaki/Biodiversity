Tree Biodiversity Dataset: Visualization and Manipulation

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a tree biodiversity dataset to understand the diversity and distribution of tree species in a given area. The aim is to explore, visualize, and manipulate the data to uncover patterns and insights about tree biodiversity.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of trees, such as species, height, diameter, and location. This dataset provides comprehensive information to analyze tree biodiversity.

Data Exploration

Inspecting the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.
Handling missing values and duplicates.
Data Manipulation

Filtering data based on specific criteria (e.g., species, location).
Aggregating data to compute statistics like mean, median, and mode.

Data Visualization

Bar plots to show the distribution of tree species.
Pie charts to represent the proportions of different species.
Scatter plots to display the relationship between tree height and diameter.
Geospatial plots to visualize the distribution of trees across different locations.
'I am working on this area'

Statistical Analysis

Diversity indices (e.g., Shannon index) to quantify biodiversity.
Correlation analysis to understand relationships between different attributes.
